### Hi there :wave:

I am Darlene, a Mathematics graduate from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and currently pursuing in Data Science and Analytics. 
Data Science and Analytics is a rapidly growing field with immense opportunities for professionals with a passion for numbers 
and an aptitude for problem-solving. I am fascinated by the power of data to reveal patterns, trends, and relationships that 
may not be immediately visible, and I relish the challenge of developing innovative solutions to complex problems.
